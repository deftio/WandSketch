## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Camera Permission
When you first open the app, you'll be prompted to allow camera access. This is required for wand tracking.

### 2. Basic Tracking
- Hold your hand up to the camera with your index finger extended (like holding a wand)
- Move your finger to see the magical trail appear on screen
- The trail will fade over time based on your trail length setting

### 3. Learning Spells

#### To learn a new spell:
1. Switch to the **Settings** tab at the bottom
2. Enter a spell name (e.g., "Lumos", "Expelliarmus")
3. Click **Learn** to start recording
4. Draw the spell pattern with your wand
5. Click **Save Spell** when finished

#### Tips for good spell patterns:
- Make distinctive shapes (circles, zigzags, letters)
- Draw at moderate speed for best recognition
- Keep patterns simple but unique
- Practice the same pattern consistently

### 4. Casting Spells
Once you've learned spells, simply draw the pattern with your wand. When recognized, the spell name will appear at the bottom of the screen for 8 seconds.

## üéÆ Controls

## üí° Tips for Best Performance

### Lighting
- Use good lighting - avoid backlighting
- Avoid harsh shadows on your hands
- Natural daylight works best

### Hand Position

- Extend your index finger like holding a wand
- Avoid rapid movements for better tracking

### Environment
- Use a contrasting background (your hand vs background)
- Minimize distracting objects in camera view
- Keep camera stable if possible

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Poor Tracking
- Check lighting conditions
- Ensure hand is clearly visible
- Try adjusting sensitivity settings
- Make sure camera has clear view of your hand

### Spells Not Recognized

- Ensure patterns are distinctive
- Try re-learning spells if recognition is poor
- Check that you're drawing at moderate speed
