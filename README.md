# ü™Ñ Spell Caster

A magical web application that uses computer vision and machine learning to track wand movements and recognize spell patterns in real-time.

**‚ú® Live Demo**: Available on [GitHub Pages](https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/)

Inspired by a visit to Hogsmeade :) 

## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ Real-time Wand Tracking

- **Pause & Freeze**: Pause tracking to freeze trails on screen

### üîÆ Spell Recognition
- **Pattern Learning**: Learn custom spell patterns by drawing with your wand (3 repetitions for accuracy)
- **Harry Potter Spells**: Pre-load 15 classic Harry Potter spells with traditional wand movements
- **Advanced Recognition**: Pattern matching using geometric normalization and vector comparison
- **Spell Library**: Save and manage multiple spells with persistent storage
- **Recognition Feedback**: Visual notifications when spells are detected

- **Sensitivity Tuning**: Fine-tune detection sensitivity (0.1-1.0, default 0.8)
- **Smoothing Controls**: Reduce jitter with adjustable smoothing (1-10 points, default 3)
- **Spell Memory Length**: Control pattern recognition sensitivity (10-50 points, default 20)
- **Persistent Storage**: All settings and spells saved automatically

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Camera Permission
When you first open the app, you'll be prompted to allow camera access. This is required for wand tracking.

### 2. Basic Tracking
- Hold your hand up to the camera with your index finger extended (like holding a wand)
- Move your finger to see the magical purple trail appear on screen
- Use the **Pause** button in the top status bar to freeze trails on screen
- The trail will fade over time based on your trail length setting

### 3. Learning Spells

#### Option 1: Load Harry Potter Spells
1. Switch to the **Spells** tab at the bottom
2. Click **"Activate Harry Potter Spells"** to load 15 pre-configured spells
3. Enable the **Spells** toggle in the top-left if it's not already on
4. Try casting: Lumos (up stroke), Alohomora (key turn), Expelliarmus (flick), etc.

#### Option 2: Learn Custom Spells
1. Switch to the **Spells** tab at the bottom
2. Enter a spell name (e.g., "Lumos", "My Custom Spell")
3. Click **Learn Spell** to start recording
4. Draw the spell pattern with your wand 3 times consistently
5. Click **Capture Pattern** after each drawing
6. The spell will be automatically saved after 3 successful patterns

#### Tips for good spell patterns:
- Make distinctive shapes (circles, zigzags, letters)
- Draw at moderate speed for best recognition
- Keep patterns simple but unique
- Practice the same pattern consistently for all 3 repetitions

### 4. Casting Spells
- Ensure the **Spells** toggle in the top-left is enabled
- Draw learned patterns with your wand
- When recognized, the spell name will appear at the bottom of the screen for 2 seconds

## üéÆ Controls

### Main Interface
- **Top-Left**: Spells toggle (enable/disable spell recognition)
- **Top-Center**: "Spell Caster" title
- **Top-Right**: Status indicators (Camera, Tracking, Wand) and Pause button
- **Bottom**: Tabbed interface with Tracker, Spells, and Settings

### Tracker Tab
- Clean, minimal interface focused on tracking
- No controls - just watch the magic happen!

### Spells Tab
- **Learn New Spell**: Enter name and record 3 consistent patterns
- **Harry Potter Spells**: Load pre-configured spell library
- **Learned Spells**: View and delete saved spells
- **Debug Information**: View tracking details when enabled

### Settings Tab

#### Camera Settings
- **Show Video Feed**: Toggle webcam preview visibility (defaults to off)
- **Flip Horizontal**: Mirror the video feed horizontally (useful for front-facing cameras)
- **Flip Vertical**: Flip the video feed vertically

#### Tracking Settings
- **Trail**: How long trails persist on screen (1-20 seconds, default 6s)
- **Sensitivity**: Detection sensitivity - higher = more responsive (0.1-1.0, default 0.8)
- **Smooth**: Reduce tracking jitter (1-10 points, default 3)
- **Spell Memory Length**: How many recent points analyzed for spell recognition (10-50, default 20)
- **Clear Trail**: Remove all current trail points from the screen

## üìä Status Indicators

- **Camera**: Green when webcam is active and accessible
- **Tracking**: Green when MediaPipe hand detection is running, shows "Paused" when frozen
- **Wand**: Green when hand/wand is detected and being tracked
- **Pause Button**: Freeze/resume tracking (trails stay visible when paused)

## üí° Tips for Best Performance

### Lighting
- Use good lighting - avoid backlighting
- Avoid harsh shadows on your hands
- Natural daylight works best
- Indoor lighting should be bright and even

### Hand Position
- Keep your hand clearly visible to the camera
- Extend your index finger like holding a wand
- Avoid rapid movements for better tracking
- Use deliberate, smooth motions for spell casting

### Environment
- Use a contrasting background (your hand vs background)
- Minimize distracting objects in camera view
- Keep camera stable if possible
- Ensure good internet connection for initial MediaPipe model loading

### Spell Recognition
- Enable the Spells toggle in the top-left corner
- Draw patterns at moderate speed (not too fast, not too slow)
- Be consistent with learned patterns
- Adjust "Spell Memory Length" in settings if recognition is too sensitive/loose

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Poor Tracking
- Check lighting conditions
- Ensure hand is clearly visible to camera
- Try adjusting sensitivity in Settings tab
- Make sure camera has clear view of your hand
- Check if other apps are using the camera

### Spells Not Recognized
- Ensure Spells toggle is enabled (top-left)
- Practice drawing patterns consistently
- Try re-learning spells if recognition is poor
- Adjust "Spell Memory Length" in Settings (lower = more responsive, higher = more stable)
- Check that you're drawing at moderate speed

### Camera Issues
- Refresh the page and re-grant camera permission
- Check that no other apps are using the camera
- Ensure camera is not blocked or covered
- Try using a different browser if issues persist

### Performance Issues
- Close other browser tabs using camera/microphone
- Ensure good internet connection for initial loading
- Try reducing trail length and smoothing settings
- Use a modern browser with WebGL support
